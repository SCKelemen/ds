## Status

Accepted

## Context

Please see the [ADRs Documentation](localhost).

## Decision

We adopt Architecture Decision Records ("ADRs") to document local architecture decision, with scope limited to one team or service. If they architecture decision affects many teams, an RFC should be published. To learn about ADRs and how to create one, please see our [ADR Documentation](localhost).

Please see the [Drawbacks of using ADRs]().
