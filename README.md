# Design System  (XDS)

A design system is used to unify the look and feel across a product spectrum/surface.  
The design systems should be leveraged to maintain a cohesive style across components, devices, and features. 

## Ownership

The design system is owned by the Branding team (UX acceleration guild).

## Architecture

A design token system will be implemented to provide a unified and centralized source of truth for design decisions  
and assets. A few options for this should be considered. Theo and design-dictionary at least.  
  
The branding also owns a few services: Branding service is responsible for the AppShell which is the compositing frontend.
This service is also responsible for whitelabeling.  

Image and asset optimization.
